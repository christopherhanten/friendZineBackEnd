<b>Concept</b><br/><br/>
<b>friendZine</b> is a Facebook-like application for small groups, with a predetermined membership. The User will log in to share comments, ideas, pictures, links, and what they are listening to, watching or reading. The main component of the application is called the Conversation. It is a feed of all of the inputs given to the app. The User can add to the conversation by directly adding comments in a provided field. They can also click icons for music, reading, tv, and links, to add them to the conversation.<br/><br/>

The minimum viable product for this application will consist of the User sign in, the Conversation, a comment text field, complete with submit button, a music button, a link button, a menu icon, and a sign out button.<br/><br/>

I feel that the main pain point will initializing the sign in / sign out functionality.
